    "text": "1.1 Context for Readers\nCar crashes, also known as car accidents, refer to incidents involving the collision of vehicles with other vehicles, obstacles or humans. These accidents can lead to property damage, injuries, and even fatalities. Due to the detrimental effects of car crashes on society as a whole, the society has turned to roadway safety research, which is a field that aims to understand the causes and consequences of accidents and injuries on the road, and to develop strategies to prevent accidents and reduce their severity."

    "text": "1.2 Motivation\nIdentifying the potential factors impacting car accidents is important in the field of road safety. In the field of road traffic accidents, numerous factors could affect each other to cause serious consequences in an incident. Studying these factors will help us effectively mitigate the potential devastating effects caused by a car crash to help developing prevention strategies. Our study aims to unravel how these diverse factors related to the vehicle, driver, and external factors may influence the severity of a crash utilizing exploratory data analysis approach. By examining individual variables and relationships between variables, we intend not only to understand the individual impact of these factors but also to discover the interplay between them."

    "text": "1.3 Research Questions\nIn this study, we aim to analyze a dataset encompassing various facets of car crashes in the U.S. to understand how the various factors interplay with each other. The questions we aim to investigate are as follow:\n\nAccident Hotspots: Which locations have the highest frequency of traffic collisions? This can help in identifying road types that may require road safety improvements.\nTime Patterns: Are there specific times of day, days of the week, or months of the year when accidents are more frequent? This information can be useful for planning traffic management depending on the time.\nCollision Causes: What are the most common causes of collisions reported in the dataset? Understanding the primary causes (e.g., speeding, distracted driving, mechanical failures) can inform preventive measures.\nImpact of Weather and Road Conditions: How do different weather conditions or road environments affect the frequency and severity of accidents? This can help in preventing adverse weather conditions and improving road maintenance.\nVehicle Types Involved: Are certain types of vehicles (e.g., passenger cars, trucks) more frequently involved in accidents? This can guide regulations and safety measures for different vehicle categories."

    "section": "2.1 Technical Description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nFor the proposed project, we plan to utilize a dataset called Crash Reporting - Drivers Data from DATA.GOV, available at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crash-reporting-drivers-data. This dataset is published and maintained by data.montgomerycountymd.gov and is updated weekly for analysis.\nThe data was collected collaboratively by several local law enforcement agencies in Montgomery County via the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS) of the Maryland State Police, including the Montgomery County Police, Gaithersburg Police, Rockville Police, and the Maryland-National Capital Park Police.\nThe dataset comprises 169,760 rows and 43 columns. For our project, we have chosen the CSV format of the dataset. Other formats of the data such as RDF, JSON, XML, and a landing page format are also available on the source website. Notably, the data includes comprehensive details of vehicle and road conditions in the reported traffic collisions.\nHowever, a known issue regarding the dataset is that it also contains unverified collision data. Such unverified information can lead to biases or inaccuracies in analyzing and interpreting different variables. Another potential issue of the data after the initial examination was the mismatch between the ACRS Report Type and the Injury Severity columns. For example, an incident was classified as Injury Crash in the ACRS Report Type but in the Injury Severity it is marked as NO APPARENT INJURY. Such mismatches lead us to the decision of using Injury Severity as it provides more specific and accurate information about the car crash. Also, in Vehicle Year column, there are abnormal data value such as 0, 9999, 2024. These are likely to be incorrect values due to manual input or missing data, so we have decided to treat those abnormal data as missing value.\nTo import the dataset into an R environment for analysis, we will use the following R script:\n\n\nCode\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Crash_Reporting_-_Drivers_Data.csv\", header = TRUE, sep=\",\",na.strings=c(\"\",\"N/A\"))\nt(head(data,1))\n\n\n                               1                                     \nReport.Number                  \"MCP3040003N\"                         \nLocal.Case.Number              \"190026050\"                           \nAgency.Name                    \"Montgomery County Police\"            \nACRS.Report.Type               \"Property Damage Crash\"               \nCrash.Date.Time                \"05/31/2019 03:00:00 PM\"              \nRoute.Type                     NA                                    \nRoad.Name                      NA                                    \nCross.Street.Type              NA                                    \nCross.Street.Name              NA                                    \nOff.Road.Description           \"PARKING LOT OF 3215 SPARTAN RD\"      \nMunicipality                   NA                                    \nRelated.Non.Motorist           NA                                    \nCollision.Type                 \"OTHER\"                               \nWeather                        \"CLEAR\"                               \nSurface.Condition              NA                                    \nLight                          \"DAYLIGHT\"                            \nTraffic.Control                NA                                    \nDriver.Substance.Abuse         \"UNKNOWN\"                             \nNon.Motorist.Substance.Abuse   NA                                    \nPerson.ID                      \"DE2A24CD-7919-4F8D-BABF-5B75CE12D21E\"\nDriver.At.Fault                \"Yes\"                                 \nInjury.Severity                \"NO APPARENT INJURY\"                  \nCircumstance                   NA                                    \nDriver.Distracted.By           \"UNKNOWN\"                             \nDrivers.License.State          NA                                    \nVehicle.ID                     \"165AD539-A8C8-4004-AF73-B7DCAAA8B3CC\"\nVehicle.Damage.Extent          \"SUPERFICIAL\"                         \nVehicle.First.Impact.Location  \"ONE OCLOCK\"                          \nVehicle.Second.Impact.Location \"ONE OCLOCK\"                          \nVehicle.Body.Type              \"PASSENGER CAR\"                       \nVehicle.Movement               \"PARKING\"                             \nVehicle.Continuing.Dir         \"North\"                               \nVehicle.Going.Dir              \"North\"                               \nSpeed.Limit                    \"15\"                                  \nDriverless.Vehicle             \"No\"                                  \nParked.Vehicle                 \"No\"                                  \nVehicle.Year                   \"2004\"                                \nVehicle.Make                   \"HONDA\"                               \nVehicle.Model                  \"TK\"                                  \nEquipment.Problems             \"UNKNOWN\"                             \nLatitude                       \"39.15004\"                            \nLongitude                      \"-77.06309\"                           \nLocation                       \"(39.15004368, -77.06308884)\"         \n\n\nThis script reads the CSV file into a data frame.

Specifically, this refinement involves the exclusion of three types of columns:\nA. Identifier columns such as Report.Number, Local.Case.Number, and Vehicle.ID, which, although useful for case identification, do not provide meaningful data for our analysis.\nB. Columns with a high rate of missing data, like Off.Road.Description and Municipality, offer limited informational value.\nC. Variables that are not directly related to our research questions, such as Vehicle.Going.Dir and Vehicle.First.Impact.Location.\nTo analyze and interpret missing values, we will employ bar charts to visualize the percentage of missing data and use the ‘plot missing’ function to identify any discernible patterns in the missing values.\n\n\nCode\n# refine dataset\ncolumns = c(\"Crash.Date.Time\", \"Route.Type\", \"Cross.Street.Type\",\n                  \"Weather\", \"Surface.Condition\", \"Light\", \n                  \"Traffic.Control\", \"Driver.Substance.Abuse\", \n                  \"Injury.Severity\", \"Driver.Distracted.By\", \n                  \"Vehicle.Damage.Extent\", \"Vehicle.Body.Type\", \n                  \"Vehicle.Movement\", \"Speed.Limit\", \"Vehicle.Year\", \n                  \"Vehicle.Make\", \"Equipment.Problems\")\ndata_refined = data[columns]\n\n# make abnormal data in 'Vehicle.Year' to NAs\ndata_refined &lt;- data_refined %&gt;%\n  mutate(Vehicle.Year = if_else(Vehicle.Year &lt; 1900 | Vehicle.Year &gt; 2023, NA_real_, Vehicle.Year))\n\n# analysis missing value\nmissing_value &lt;- colSums(is.na(data_refined))/dim(data_refined)[1]*100 |&gt; \n  sort(decreasing = TRUE)\n\nmissing_data_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  Column = names(missing_value),\n  NAs = missing_value\n)\n\n# plot percentage of missing value\nggplot(missing_data_df, aes(x = reorder(Column, NAs), y = NAs)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Variables\", y = \"Percentage of Missing Values(%)\", title = \"Missing Value Persentage of Refined Variables\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the bar chart, it is evident that all the variables of interest have less than 20% missing values.
