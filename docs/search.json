    "text": "1 Introduction\nUnderstanding and identifying the factors impacting traffic accidents is important in the field of road safety. In the intricate landscape of road traffic accidents, numerous variables intertwine to paint a complex picture of each incident. Studying these factors will help us effectively mitigate the potential devastating effects caused by a car crash. In this study, we aim to study a dataset encompassing various facets of crash reporting in the U.S., including but not limited to, specifics like ‘Speed Limit’, ‘Vehicle Direction’, and ‘Driver Substance Abuse’ to understand how the various factors interplay with each other. Each column, ranging from ‘Collision Type’ to ‘Weather Conditions’, to ‘Light’, potentially holds critical insights into the causative factors of road accidents. Our study aims to unravel how these diverse factors related to the vehicle, driver, and external factors may influence the severity of a crash by utilizing exploratory data analysis approach. By examining individual variables and relationships between variables, we intend not only to understand the individual impact of these factors but also to discover the interplay between them.\nThe questions we aim to investigate are as follow:\n\nAccident Hotspots: Which locations have the highest frequency of traffic collisions? This can help in identifying areas that may require road safety improvements or increased traffic enforcement.\nTime Patterns: Are there specific times of day, days of the week, or months of the year when accidents are more frequent? This information can be useful for planning traffic management strategies and public awareness campaigns.\nCollision Causes: What are the most common causes of collisions reported in the dataset? Understanding the primary causes (e.g., speeding, distracted driving, mechanical failures) can inform preventive measures and educational programs.\nImpact of Weather and Road Conditions: How do different weather conditions or road environments affect the frequency and severity of accidents? This can help in planning for adverse weather conditions and improving road maintenance.\nVehicle Types Involved: Are certain types of vehicles (e.g., motorcycles, trucks) more frequently involved in accidents? This can guide regulations and safety measures for different vehicle categories."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nFor the proposed project, we plan to utilize a dataset called Crash Reporting - Drivers Data from DATA.GOV, available at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crash-reporting-drivers-data. This dataset is published and maintained by data.montgomerycountymd.gov and is updated weekly for analysis.\nThe data collection process involves several local law enforcement agencies within Montgomery County, including the Montgomery County Police, Gaithersburg Police, Rockville Police, and the Maryland-National Capital Park Police. These agencies contribute to the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS) of the Maryland State Police, which compiles the data.\nThe dataset comprises 169,760 rows and 43 columns. For our project, we have chosen the CSV format of the dataset. Meanwhile, other formats of the data such as RDF, JSON, XML, and a landing page format are also available on the source website. One significant aspect about the data is that it includes comprehensive details of vehicle conditions and road conditions in the reported traffic collisions. However, a known issue with the dataset is that it contains both verified and unverified collision data. Such discrepancies can lead to biases or inaccuracies in analyzing and interpreting different variables.\nTo import the dataset into an R environment for analysis, we will use the following R script:\n\n\nCode\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Crash_Reporting_-_Drivers_Data.csv\", header = TRUE, sep=\",\")\nhead(data)\n\n\n  Report.Number Local.Case.Number               Agency.Name\n1
