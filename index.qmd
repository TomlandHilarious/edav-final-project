# Introduction
Understanding and identifying the factors impacting traffic accidents is important in the field of road safety. In the intricate landscape of road traffic accidents, numerous variables intertwine to paint a complex picture of each incident. Studying these factors will help us effectively mitigate the potential devastating effects caused by a car crash. In this study, we aim to study a dataset encompassing various facets of crash reporting in the U.S., including but not limited to, specifics like 'Speed Limit', 'Vehicle Direction', and 'Driver Substance Abuse' to understand how the various factors interplay with each other. Each column, ranging from 'Collision Type' to 'Weather Conditions', to 'Light', potentially holds critical insights into the causative factors of road accidents. Our study aims to unravel how these diverse factors related to the vehicle, driver, and external factors may influence the severity of a crash by utilizing exploratory data analysis approach. By examining individual variables and relationships between variables, we intend not only to understand the individual impact of these factors but also to discover the interplay between them. 

The questions we aim to investigate are as follow:

1. **Accident Hotspots**: Which locations have the highest frequency of traffic collisions? This can help in identifying areas that may require road safety improvements or increased traffic enforcement.

2. **Time Patterns**: Are there specific times of day, days of the week, or months of the year when accidents are more frequent? This information can be useful for planning traffic management strategies and public awareness campaigns.

3. **Collision Causes**: What are the most common causes of collisions reported in the dataset? Understanding the primary causes (e.g., speeding, distracted driving, mechanical failures) can inform preventive measures and educational programs.

4. **Impact of Weather and Road Conditions**: How do different weather conditions or road environments affect the frequency and severity of accidents? This can help in planning for adverse weather conditions and improving road maintenance.

5. Vehicle Types Involved: Are certain types of vehicles (e.g., motorcycles, trucks) more frequently involved in accidents? This can guide regulations and safety measures for different vehicle categories.
