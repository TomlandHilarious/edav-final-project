# Introduction
## Context for Readers
Car crashes, also known as car accidents, refer to incidents involving the collision of vehicles with other vehicles, obstacles or humans. These accidents can lead to property damage, injuries, and even fatalities. Due to the detrimental effects of car crashes on society as a whole, the society has turned to roadway safety research, which is a field that aims to understand the causes and consequences of accidents and injuries on the road, and to develop strategies to prevent accidents and reduce their severity.

## Motivation
Identifying the potential factors impacting car accidents is important in the field of road safety. In the field of road traffic accidents, numerous factors could affect each other to cause serious consequences in an incident. Studying these factors will help us effectively mitigate the potential devastating effects caused by a car crash to help developing prevention strategies. Our study aims to unravel how these diverse factors related to the vehicle, driver, and external factors may influence the severity of a crash utilizing exploratory data analysis approach. By examining individual variables and relationships between variables, we intend not only to understand the individual impact of these factors but also to discover the interplay between them. 

## Research Questions
In this study, we aim to analyze a dataset encompassing various facets of car crashes in the U.S. to understand how the various factors interplay with each other. The questions we aim to investigate are as follow:

1. **Accident Hotspots**: Which locations have the highest frequency of traffic collisions? This can help in identifying road types that may require road safety improvements.

2. **Time Patterns**: Are there specific times of day, days of the week, or months of the year when accidents are more frequent? This information can be useful for planning traffic management depending on the time.

3. **Collision Causes**: What are the most common causes of collisions reported in the dataset? Understanding the primary causes (e.g., speeding, distracted driving, mechanical failures) can inform preventive measures.

4. **Impact of Weather and Road Conditions**: How do different weather conditions or road environments affect the frequency and severity of accidents? This can help in preventing adverse weather conditions and improving road maintenance.

5. **Vehicle Types Involved**: Are certain types of vehicles (e.g., passenger cars, trucks) more frequently involved in accidents? This can guide regulations and safety measures for different vehicle categories.
